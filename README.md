# NLP-Wikidata-Knowledge-Graph

This notebook demonstrates the utilization of the WikiData API and the Wikipedia API to gather comprehensive information about the winners of the prestigious ACM Turing Award. The ACM Turing Award, presented annually by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), recognizes individuals who have made significant and enduring contributions to the field of computer science.

The primary objectives achieved in this analysis are as follows:

**Creation of a Text Corpus:** We collect relevant data from various online sources to build a comprehensive text corpus.
**Text Data Processing and NLP Operations:** We perform necessary preprocessing and apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract valuable insights from the collected text data.
**Visualization of Results:** We utilize the powerful visualization capabilities of matplotlib to present the obtained results in a clear and intuitive manner.

By leveraging these techniques, we aim to gain valuable insights into the achievements and impact of the ACM Turing Award winners in the realm of computer science.
